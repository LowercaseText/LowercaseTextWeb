              <h2>Development info</h2>
                <p>Progress on this game is very slow. I keep getting distracted by doing other projects, as well as the code for this game is getting very messy, However I still aim to finish this game. I like this game and the Idea a lot. I will probably make devlogs/updates on this game in my blog.</p>
